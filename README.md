Welcome to my hackathon README.md

This is my submission for Mintbean.io's Hiring Hackathon November 16-23 2021. This project is composed of HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and React. 

I worked very hard on this project the past week and I have learned so much. I have just started learning React through Skillcrush's Break Into Tech Front End Developer track so this was a perfect project to put my new skills to the test. 

I would like to thank Alison Quaglia for her UX Collective article as I followed it pretty much to the letter. She also helped me with my questions when I reached out to her on Twitter. I so appreciate it Alison! 

There is one bug I know for certain in my code, that I am not sure how to fix. It is that my SVG does not resize to fit mobile screens. Therefore you can only colour in half of the flower on a mobile screen. I have looked into fixing it but all my methods have not succeeded. Any feedback on how to fix this would be greatly appreciated! 

I would like to thank Mintbean.io for the awesome hackathon and readily available help on Discord. I had a ton of fun and can't wait to sign up for the next one!
