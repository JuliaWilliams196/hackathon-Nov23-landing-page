        <h3>Description of Application &amp; Creative Process</h3>
        <p>When I first found out the challenge for this hackathon I was super excited.
             I originally wanted to do a paint by numbers web page, but after looking into it I
              determined it was too much for my skill set right now.</p>
        <p>Instead, I created a flower colouring page using an SVG of a sunflower. 
            I found an article on UX Collective by Alison Quaglia that used React to create what I wanted to do. 
            Since I am learning React in my Skillcrush Break Into Tech Program Front End Developer track,
             I though it would be neat to use the skills I have so far to create something challenging but still familiar.   </p>
<p>I originally was going to use a mandala for my colouring page but all the SVGs I wanted to use didnt have enough paths
     for filling in the sections. I ended up using Alison's image as it had paths for all parts of the flowers.
      To make my project different from Alison's I made my "stroke-width" on all paths a "1" and changed the colour blocks
       at the bottom to be circular instead of square and with no shadow.</p>    
    <h3>Product Features</h3>
    <p>This project uses HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and React. It is a simple click and fill design 
        where you click a colour, then click a part of the flower you want that colour, click it and boom!
        It's that beautiful colour you just selected!</p>
